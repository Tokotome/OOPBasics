//Create a hierarchy of Animals.Your task is simple: there should be a base class which all others derive from.
//Your program should have 3 different animals – Dog, Frog and Cat.Let’s go deeper in the hierarchy and create
//two additional classes – Kitten and Tomcat.Kittens are female and Tomcats are male! We are ready now, but the 
//task is not complete. Along with the animals, there should be and a class which classifies its derived classes 
//as sound producible.You may guess that all animals are sound producible. The only one mandatory functionality 
//of all sound producible objects is to produceSound(). For instance, the dog should bark.
//Your task is to model the hierarchy and test its functionality.Create an animal of all kinds and make them produce
//sound. On the console, you will be given some lines of code. Each two lines of code, represents animals and their 
//names, age and gender.On the first line there will be the kind of animal, you should instantiate.And on the next 
//line, you will be given the name, the age and the gender.Stop the process of gathering input, when the command “Beast!” is given.
